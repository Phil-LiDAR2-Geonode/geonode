<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class = "test"><div align = "justify">
Forest Resource Extraction from LiDAR Surveys (FRExLS) is a project under PHIL-LIDAR 2: Nationwide Detailed Resources Assessment using LiDAR, funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and being monitored by the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD-DOST). The project is being implemented by the UP Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry (UP TCAGP) in partnership with the other State Universities, Colleges and other Higher Educational Institutions all over the country. The project aspires generally in developing a workflow producing forest resources maps that can be used by decision-makers in the monitoring and management of the remaining forest resources of the country.</div>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<br>
<br>
The project intends to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.) produce detailed maps featuring canopy heights and canopy cover, produce models of the forest aboveground biomass and carbon stock estimates; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.) differentiate various forest types applicable in the Philippines using LiDAR point cloud pattern descriptions; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.) conduct field data calibration and validation of the produced maps on the actual ground; and ultimately,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.) develop techniques, algorithms and workflows for extracting key features from LiDAR point cloud data.<br>
